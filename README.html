        To maximize capabilities, it's recommended that you allow My Tokens to patch DotNetNuke core.

        How does it work?
    </div>

    DotNetNuke doesn't have a mechanism to provide other token replacers,
    so My Tokens only works with modules that have been already integrated with 
    (see <a class="blue" href = "http://www.avatar-soft.ro/dotnetnuke/modules/token-replacement/my-tokens.aspx">My Tokens page</a> for list of supported standard and commercial modules).
    Patching the core means replacing DotNetNuke.dll with another file we precompile to fully support My Tokens.

        Benefits of patching the DNN core
    </div>
    Patching the core will make My Tokens available in all places where standard token replacing is supported.
    This includes a large number of standard or commercial modules.

        How to undo the patch
    </div>
    Note that My Tokens will make a backup of your current <u>/bin/DotNetNuke.dll</u> file and put it under <u>/DesktopModules/avt.MyTokens/Backup</u>.
    So if you later need to undo the patch, just copy the backup back to the /bin folder.
